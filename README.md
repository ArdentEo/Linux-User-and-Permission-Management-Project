<h1>Linux User Access Management Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab concentrates on managing user authentication and authorization in a Linux environment, I utilized Bash shell commands to achieve this. The lab encompassed administering user and group accounts, handling file ownership and permissions, and implementing security best practices. By ensuring proper access controls, I enhanced the system's security posture and gained proficiency in essential command-line tools and scripting.
<br />


<h2>Steps</h2>

1. Implemented user authentication mechanisms by adding new users **`(useradd)`** to a Linux system, simulating the onboarding process in an organizational environment.

2. Configured primary and secondary group memberships using **`usermod -g`** and **`usermod -aG`**, allowing for structured access control and facilitating inter-departmental collaboration between Research and Sales teams.

3. Managed file ownership and permissions with **`chown`**, assigning project files to appropriate users to maintain accountability and data integrity.

4. Executed user deprovisioning procedures using **`userdel`** and **`groupdel`** to securely remove users and their associated groups which emulates a user's departure, ensuring no residual access remained.

5. In this project I aimed to better my knowledge of Linux security practices, reinforcing the importance of proper user management in preventing unauthorized access.
